Itsyrific | Twitterrific 4 for Itsy
=========

Theme for Itsy 2.0 based on the Twitterrific for Mac app. Ported to Itsy with the [permission of David Lanham](https://github.com/paddykontschak/Itsyrific/raw/master/screenshot/dlanham.png).

You have to download [Itsy](http://mowglii.com/itsy/) to use this theme.

Twitterrific and various images I used for the toolbar and the idea of the design in the first place belong to Iconfactory and/or David Lanham. You can download a trial or buy Twitterrific at [The Iconfactory](http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific).
